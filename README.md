# Order volume Predictor 
Summary: One of Kepler's clients, Shazamazon, is an eCommerce retail store selling custom-made thingamabobs. Kepler's media team has been tasked with driving more Shazamazon orders to help them get a bigger foothold in the market. But before we start spending our client's money on advertising, we want to better understand what sorts of customer behaviors drive order volume so that our media team can target the most impactful parts of the customer journey.

 

At Kepler's request, Shazamazon provided the attached data set showing daily order volume across each of their target regions, along with the number of emails customers have opened, the average purchase value for each order, the number of social media likes, and the number of website visits. Despite being a retail provider, Shazamazon has confirmed that they never see seasonal variations in order volume, nor do they see any meaningful difference across regions.
